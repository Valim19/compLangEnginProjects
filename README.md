# 🧠 Compiler Engineering Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects from a course on **Computer Language Engineering** (Compilers). This repository contains hands-on implementations covering key components of compiler construction — from lexical analysis to code generation.

---

## 📁 Structure

Each project is in its own folder:

| Project Folder | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `project1/`    | Scanner and parser |
| `project2/`    | Semantic checker |
| `project3/`    | Code generation |
| `project4/`    | Dataflow optimizations |
| `project5/`    | Optimizer |

## 🛠️ Technologies

- Language: **C**
- Tools: `flex`, `bison`, `gcc`
- Platform: Linux/macOS (tested on Debian)
